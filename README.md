Hello,

we can take it from the beginning.

I've been looking for a clean Ender 3 pro software but can't find anything that makes sense at all,

from there I think why not create one myself, for you and maybe with your help,

I'm not a programmer or an electrician, so I'm asking you to help me with this project.

and I am completely now in github with so if anyone can help me with this as well, you are very welcome in the whole thing with.

contact me here on github or at mackangotgard@gmail.com
